# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application designed to accomodate students viewing and booking interviews. This is a Lighthouse Labs project designed primarily to teach the use of React as well as the basics of testing using unit testing, integration testing and end-to-end testing. Testing is done using Jest, Storybook and Cypress.
